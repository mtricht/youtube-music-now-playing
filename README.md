# youtube-music-now-playing
Plugin for [th-ch/youtube-music](https://github.com/th-ch/youtube-music) that saves the current playing song to a file named `foobar_np.txt`, much like the Foobar2000 [now playing plugin](https://skipyrich.com/wiki/Foobar2000:Now_Playing_Simple).

Created to be used with [gamesense-essentials](https://mtricht.github.io/gamesense-essentials/).
